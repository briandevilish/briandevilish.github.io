For 32-bit pattern such as 0x12345678 stored at address 0x00400000. The most significant byte (MSB) is 0x12; the least significant is 0x78.

* Big Endian Byte Order: The most significant byte (the "big end"/MSB) of the data is placed at the byte with the lowest address. The rest of the data is placed in order in the next three bytes in memory. This is the default way network sends data.

```
12          34          56          78
0x00400000  0x00400001  0x00400002  0x00400003
```

* Little Endian Byte Order: The least significant byte (the "little end"/LSB) of the data is placed at the byte with the lowest address. The rest of the data is placed in order in the next three bytes in memory.

```
78          56          34          12
0x00400000  0x00400001  0x00400002  0x00400003
```
